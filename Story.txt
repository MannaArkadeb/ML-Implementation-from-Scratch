Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named Cinderella. She was a kind, gentle, and beautiful child with the most radiant smile. Cinderella had a heart full of love, but unfortunately, fate hadn’t been kind to Cinderella. Her mother had passed away, leaving her alone with her selfish stepmother.
The stepmother had two daughters of her own, and she was terribly jealous of Cinderella’s beauty and kind heart. She treated Cinderella unfairly, making her do all the housework and dress in rags while her own daughters wore fine clothes and lived in luxury.
Despite the cruelty she faced, Cinderella remained kind and gentle, never letting her stepmother’s unkindness change who she was. She would often seek comfort in the garden, talking to the birds and the animals, who had become her dearest friends.
One day, the kingdom received exciting news. The prince was hosting a grand ball at the palace, and every maiden in the land was invited. Cinderella’s stepsisters were overjoyed and spent weeks preparing their gowns and practicing their dance moves.
Cinderella watched her stepsisters with a sad smile, hoping she might be able to attend the ball and experience a bit of the magic she had heard about in her mother’s stories. But her stepmother was insistent that Cinderella would stay home and continue with her chores.
The night of the ball arrived, and Cinderella was left alone in her old clothes while her stepsisters and stepmother departed for the palace. She sat by the fireplace, tears in her eyes, wishing for just a taste of the magic her mother had told her about.
Suddenly, a soft, sweet voice filled the room. It was her fairy godmother, a beautiful figure surrounded by a soft, glowing light.
“Why are you crying, my dear?” the fairy godmother asked.
Cinderella explained her wish to attend the ball but how her stepmother had been unkind and refused to allow her to go.
The fairy godmother smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my child. You shall go to the ball.”
With a wave of her wand, Cinderella’s rags were transformed into a stunning gown, and on her feet, she wore the most delicate glass slippers that sparkled like stars. Her fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage and mice into beautiful horses, so Cinderella could travel to the palace in style.
Before she left, the fairy godmother gave Cinderella a piece of advice: “Remember, my dear, the magic will only last until midnight. When the clock strikes twelve, you must leave the palace and return home.”
Cinderella thanked her fairy godmother and climbed into the magical carriage. As she arrived at the palace, she felt like a princess, her heart dancing with joy.
The moment Cinderella entered the ballroom, the entire room fell silent. The prince, charmed by her beauty, approached her, and they danced together like a dream. Cinderella was the happiest she had ever been.
But as the hours flew by, she suddenly heard the bells of the palace clock. The first stroke of midnight sent a shiver down her spine. She remembered her fairy godmother’s warning and knew she must leave.
Cinderella hurriedly said goodbye to the prince and fled from the palace. As she ran down the grand staircase, one of her glass slippers slipped off her foot. She didn’t have time to retrieve it, and so, with only one glass slipper, she disappeared into the night.
Cinderella’s beautiful gown and glass slippers turned back into rags, leaving her with only the memory of the enchanting evening she had spent at the palace.
The next day, the prince was determined to find the owner of the glass slipper. He and his attendants traveled throughout the kingdom, visiting every home to see if the slipper would fit any young maiden.
When they arrived at Cinderella’s cottage, her stepsisters eagerly tried to fit their feet into the glass slipper. But it was too small for them, and their feet simply couldn’t squeeze in.
Cinderella watched, hidden from view, as her stepsisters attempted to trick the prince. Then, she stepped forward and, with a hopeful heart, asked, “May I try?”
The prince agreed, and as she placed her foot into the glass slipper, it fit perfectly. The prince’s eyes lit up with joy as he realized he had found the maiden he had danced with at the ball.
Cinderella’s stepsisters were astonished and upset. But even though they were mean to her, Cinderella didn’t feel angry. Instead, she forgave them for their unkindness, as she believed that kindness was the most important thing in the world.
And so, Cinderella was reunited with the prince, and they lived happily ever after, proving that goodness, kindness, and a loving heart could overcome the challenges life may bring.

The end!
    Moral of the Story:
    Being kind and having a loving heart can help you through tough times. Even though Cinderella faced meanness and hard work, she stayed kind and gentle, and her goodness led to her happiness and success. The story also shows the importance of forgiveness, as Cinderella forgave her stepsisters, teaching us that being kind and forgiving are very important.
Once upon a time, in a small village deep in a forest, there lived a kind young woman named Belle. She loved reading books, and everyone knew her for her warm heart and her beauty. Belle had dark hair like the night, eyes as deep as the ocean, and a spirit as free as a bird.
Belle lived with her father, Maurice, who was an inventor. He made new gadgets and gizmos, and Belle loved listening to his stories and helping him with his experiments. The villagers thought Belle was different because she loved books and dreamed of adventures, but Belle didn’t mind.
One day, Maurice set off on a journey to show his invention to another village. On the way, he got lost in the dark, scary forest. The wind howled, and the trees seemed to whisper secrets. Maurice found a big, spooky castle and went inside to find shelter.
Inside, he met the owner of the castle, a scary Beast. The Beast was once a handsome prince, but an enchantress had turned him into a Beast because he was selfish and mean. To break the curse, someone had to love him despite his appearance.
The Beast locked Maurice in a dungeon for trespassing. Maurice’s horse, Philippe, ran back to the village to tell Belle what happened. Belle bravely went to the castle to rescue her father. When she found him in the dungeon, she offered to take his place as the Beast’s prisoner. The Beast agreed and let Maurice go.
Belle stayed in the castle and found the Beast was not only scary but also sad and lonely. She discovered a huge library and loved reading the books. Over time, Belle and the Beast talked, read, and shared stories. Belle learned about the curse and wanted to help break it. The Beast began to care for Belle’s intelligence, beauty, and kindness.
Meanwhile, Gaston, a boastful man from the village who wanted to marry Belle, made a plan to force her into marriage. He gathered the villagers and went to the castle, where a big fight happened.
The Beast, who loved Belle, fought to protect her. When Gaston’s plan was revealed, the villagers turned against him. Belle’s love for the Beast and the Beast’s love for her broke the curse. The Beast turned back into a handsome prince, and Belle’s kindness was rewarded.
Belle and the prince got married in a grand ceremony, surrounded by the enchanted objects in the castle that had also been freed from the curse. The villagers learned to appreciate Belle’s unique qualities, and Belle and the prince lived happily ever after.
And so, my dear child, that is the end of the story of Beauty and the Beast. It teaches us that true beauty is inside us, and love and kindness can change even the hardest problems. Now, close your eyes and dream of a world full of magic and love. Goodnight, and may your dreams be as beautiful as Belle’s heart.

The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you.
Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons. Along with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun. The Sun is one among hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.
The Milky Way is but one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe — all of them, including our own, are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. All the stars in all the galaxies and all the other stuff that astronomers can’t even observe are all part of the universe. It is, simply, everything.
Though the universe may seem a strange place, it is not a distant one. Wherever you are right now, outer space is only 62 miles (100 kilometers) away. Day or night, whether you’re indoors or outdoors, asleep, eating lunch or dozing off in class, outer space is just a few dozen miles above your head. It’s below you too. About 8,000 miles (12,800 kilometers) below your feet — on the opposite side of Earth — lurks the unforgiving vacuum and radiation of outer space.
In fact, you’re technically in space right now. Humans say “out in space” as if it’s there and we’re here, as if Earth is separate from the rest of the universe. But Earth is a planet, and it’s in space and part of the universe just like the other planets. It just so happens that things live here and the environment near the surface of this particular planet is hospitable for life as we know it. Earth is a tiny, fragile exception in the cosmos. For humans and the other things living on our planet, practically the entire cosmos is a hostile and merciless environment.
Our planet, Earth, is an oasis not only in space, but in time. It may feel permanent, but the entire planet is a fleeting thing in the lifespan of the universe. For nearly two-thirds of the time since the universe began, Earth did not even exist. Nor will it last forever in its current state. Several billion years from now, the Sun will expand, swallowing Mercury and Venus, and filling Earth’s sky. It might even expand large enough to swallow Earth itself. It’s difficult to be certain. After all, humans have only just begun deciphering the cosmos.
While the distant future is difficult to accurately predict, the distant past is slightly less so. By studying the radioactive decay of isotopes on Earth and in asteroids, scientists have learned that our planet and the solar system formed around 4.6 billion years ago.
The universe, on the other hand, appears to be about 13.8 billion years old. Scientists arrived at that number by measuring the ages of the oldest stars and the rate at which the universe expands. They also measured the expansion by observing the Doppler shift in light from galaxies, almost all of which are traveling away from us and from each other. The farther the galaxies are, the faster they’re traveling away. One might expect gravity to slow the galaxies’ motion from one another, but instead they’re speeding up and scientists don’t know why. In the distant future, the galaxies will be so far away that their light will not be visible from Earth.
